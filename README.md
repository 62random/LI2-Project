#LI2 - Project

This was an assignment for a course in which we had to develop a roguelike game. One of the objective of this course was to use our knowledge of Imperative Programming. 

The tools we used were the C language, CGI and Apache 2.0.
The C program was placed in the cgi directory and gave output (in the form of HTML code)  that was served through apache to any web browser connecting to localhost.

The main challenge of this project was to correctly generate the map and to program the behaviour of NPC's such as enemies.

In this project, I also implemented a bot to simulate human gameplay.
